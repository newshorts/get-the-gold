To get this working:

Right now the bookmark loads a script from amazon called "amalgam".

To get this working on local, point the script to the local version of "amalgam"

Then inside the local copy, change the stylesheet that gets loaded to a local stylesheet

Once your done, change everything back and upload the changes to s3
